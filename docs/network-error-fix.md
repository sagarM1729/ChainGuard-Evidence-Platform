# 🔧 Network Error Fix & Pinata Resilience Strategy

## Problem Solved
You were seeing `NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource` because:
1. Pinata credentials were missing or invalid
2. The Pinata gateway was unreachable from your environment
3. There was no graceful fallback when uploads failed

## ✅ Applied Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
**File**: `src/lib/pinata-client.ts`
- ✅ Wraps fetch calls with try/catch and descriptive errors
- ✅ Generates deterministic mock CIDs when uploads fail
- ✅ Logs detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting

### 2. Resilient IPFS Service Layer
**File**: `src/lib/ipfs-upload.ts`
- ✅ Primary path: Pinata → returns real CIDs
- ✅ Fallback path: deterministic mock CIDs for offline/dev mode
- ✅ Provider status reporting via `testProviders`

### 3. Evidence Manager Updates
**File**: `src/services/evidenceManager.ts`
- ✅ Uploads through Pinata client with integrity checks
- ✅ Recomputes Merkle roots after successful writes
- ✅ Provides verbose logging to trace verification failures

### 4. Diagnostic API Endpoints
**Files**:
- `src/app/api/test-pinata/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/test-pinata-debug/route.ts`

Use these endpoints to verify credentials and inspect environment metadata from the browser.

### 5. Improved Evidence Viewer UX
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/cases/[caseId]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Detects development-only CIDs
- ✅ Displays helpful messages instead of blank pages
- ✅ Prevents failed download attempts when offline

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### During Evidence Upload
1. **Pinata primary** – Successful uploads return production CIDs.
2. **Fallback mock CID** – When Pinata is unreachable, a deterministic `dev-` CID is returned.
3. **Metadata preserved** – Case, evidence, and Merkle data remain consistent regardless of provider status.

### When Viewing Evidence
1. **Real CIDs** – Open via your configured Pinata gateway.
2. **Mock CIDs** – Render an informational placeholder explaining the offline state.
3. **No surprises** – Users always receive actionable feedback.

## 🔍 Testing Your Fix

### Quick Check
1. Upload evidence through the dashboard.
2. Inspect server logs for `Server-side Pinata upload successful`.
3. Open the CID in a new tab—verify via the Pinata gateway.

### Detailed Diagnosis
Visit these endpoints:
- `http://localhost:3000/api/test-pinata`
- `http://localhost:3000/api/test-pinata-debug`

The JSON responses confirm authentication, rate limits, and gateway configuration.

## 🌐 Pinata Configuration

```bash
# Add one of the following to .env.local
PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_here
# or
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key_here
PINATA_API_SECRET=your_pinata_api_secret_here

# Optional custom gateway
# PINATA_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-gateway.example.com/ipfs
```

## 🔄 Fallback Hierarchy

1. **Pinata (Primary)** – Reliable IPFS uploads via JWT or API key/secret.
2. **Deterministic mock CID (Fallback)** – Keeps the UI and database consistent when offline.

## 📋 What Changed for You

### Before
- ❌ Uploads failed silently when the Pinata gateway was unreachable
- ❌ Blank pages appeared when viewing evidence
- ❌ Merkle ledger roots remained empty

### After
- ✅ Pinata errors surface clearly with actionable guidance
- ✅ Evidence uploads complete with real or mock CIDs
- ✅ Users see meaningful messages instead of blank screens
- ✅ Merkle ledger snapshots stay up-to-date

## 🎯 Result

**Your evidence upload system is now resilient.** Even if Pinata/IPFS experiences downtime, ChainGuard continues to function with deterministic fallbacks and transparent diagnostics.
