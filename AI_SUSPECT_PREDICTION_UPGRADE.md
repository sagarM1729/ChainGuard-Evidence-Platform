# AI Suspect Prediction Upgrade

## Overview
The AI analysis system has been upgraded to focus on **suspect profiling and prediction** using only Google Gemini AI, removing the dependency on Google Custom Search.

## What Changed

### 1. Removed Google Custom Search Integration
- âœ… Removed `googleapis` package from dependencies
- âœ… Deleted `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` from `.env.local`
- âœ… Removed `searchWebForContext()` function from analyze API route
- âœ… Deleted `docs/google-custom-search-setup.md`
- âœ… Updated documentation to remove all Google Custom Search references

### 2. Enhanced AI Analysis with Suspect Prediction

#### New Backend Interface (`src/app/api/cases/[caseId]/analyze/route.ts`)
```typescript
interface LikelySuspect {
  profile: string              // Description of suspect type/profile
  reasoning: string            // Why this person might be suspect
  evidenceSupporting: string[] // Evidence that supports this theory
}

interface SuspectProfile {
  likelySuspects: LikelySuspect[] // Array of potential suspects
  motivePrediction: string         // Predicted motive (WHY)
  modusPrediction: string          // Predicted modus operandi (HOW)
}

interface NextStep {
  step: string                      // What action to take
  priority: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW' // Investigation priority
  reasoning: string                 // Why this step is important
}

interface CaseSummary {
  summary: string[]
  keyEntities: KeyEntities
  suspectProfile: SuspectProfile    // NEW: Suspect predictions
  suggestedNextSteps: NextStep[]    // UPDATED: Now structured with priority
}
```

#### Enhanced Gemini AI Prompt
The AI now receives detailed instructions to:
- **Profile suspects** based on evidence patterns, location data, and case details
- **Predict motives** (WHY someone would commit this crime)
- **Predict modus operandi** (HOW the crime was likely committed)
- **Prioritize investigative steps** with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priorities
- Provide **point-by-point reasoning** for each suspect prediction

### 3. Updated Frontend (`src/components/cases/AIIntelligenceEngine.tsx`)

#### New Suspect Profile Section
- **ðŸ”Ž Suspect Profile & Predictions** - New section displaying:
  - **ðŸ‘¤ Likely Suspects** - Cards showing:
    - Suspect profile description
    - Reasoning for suspicion
    - Supporting evidence bullet points
  - **ðŸ’­ Predicted Motive** - Analysis of WHY
  - **ðŸŽ¯ Predicted Modus Operandi** - Analysis of HOW

#### Enhanced Next Steps Display
- Priority-based color coding:
  - **HIGH** = Red badge (urgent actions)
  - **MEDIUM** = Yellow badge (important but not urgent)
  - **LOW** = Green badge (follow-up actions)
- Each step shows:
  - Action description
  - Priority level
  - Reasoning for priority

## Usage

### Running AI Analysis
1. Navigate to any case details page
2. Click **"Run Full Analysis"** in the AI Intelligence Engine card
3. Wait 5-15 seconds for Gemini to analyze the case
4. Review the results in three tabs:
   - **Summary**: Case overview, entities, suspect predictions, next steps
   - **Related Cases**: Similar cases in the database
   - **External**: Placeholder (currently empty)

### What to Expect in Results

#### Suspect Profile Example:
```
Likely Suspects:
  1. "Ex-partner with history of domestic disputes"
     Reasoning: "Evidence shows familiarity with victim's routine..."
     Supporting Evidence:
       â€¢ Text messages showing conflict pattern
       â€¢ Witness statements about arguments
       â€¢ Location data matching crime scene

Predicted Motive: "Crime of passion triggered by jealousy..."
Predicted Modus Operandi: "Premeditated attack using victim's known schedule..."
```

#### Next Steps Example:
```
HIGH PRIORITY:
  â€¢ Interview ex-partner immediately
    Reasoning: Strong circumstantial evidence and opportunity

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
  â€¢ Subpoena phone records for victim's contacts
    Reasoning: May reveal additional suspects or confirm timeline

LOW PRIORITY:
  â€¢ Canvas neighborhood for additional witnesses
    Reasoning: Supplement existing witness statements
```

## Technical Details

### AI Model
- **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- **Context Window**: 1M tokens
- **Output Limit**: 65K tokens
- **Response Format**: JSON with structured suspect profiling

### Rate Limits
- **Free Tier**: 15 requests/minute
- **Typical Analysis Time**: 5-15 seconds
- **Max Input**: All case evidence + descriptions

### Error Handling
- Fallback analysis provided if Gemini API fails
- Error messages shown in UI with retry button
- Detailed error logging in server console

## Benefits of This Upgrade

1. **Simplified Architecture** - One AI service instead of two
2. **Cost Reduction** - No Google Custom Search API costs
3. **Better Predictions** - Gemini 2.5 Flash is highly capable at reasoning tasks
4. **Actionable Intelligence** - Prioritized next steps help investigators focus
5. **Evidence-Based** - Every prediction backed by evidence references

## Files Changed

### Backend
- `src/app/api/cases/[caseId]/analyze/route.ts` - Removed Google Search, added suspect profiling
- `package.json` - Removed `googleapis` dependency

### Frontend
- `src/components/cases/AIIntelligenceEngine.tsx` - New suspect profile UI, priority badges

### Documentation
- `AI_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Updated to remove Custom Search references
- `docs/ai-analysis-troubleshooting.md` - Updated Issue 7 explanation
- `verify-ai-setup.sh` - Removed Custom Search test
- `docs/google-custom-search-setup.md` - DELETED (no longer needed)

### Environment
- `.env.local` - Removed `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Test the AI analysis on an existing case
2. âœ… Verify suspect predictions are helpful and accurate
3. âœ… Monitor Gemini API usage and costs
4. Consider adding:
   - Confidence scores for suspect predictions
   - Integration with evidence timeline visualization
   - Historical pattern matching across cases

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run AI analysis on a case with multiple evidence files
- [ ] Verify suspect profile section displays correctly
- [ ] Check priority badges show correct colors (RED/YELLOW/GREEN)
- [ ] Confirm no Google Custom Search errors in console
- [ ] Test with rate limiting (run multiple analyses quickly)
- [ ] Verify fallback analysis works if Gemini fails
